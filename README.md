                <li> The silly joke mixed with corona talk continues till 22 March. Just like a true Ms No Bullshit, she post an optimistic song to lift their spirit or to shut them(still a mystery</li>
                <p> But alas Ms No bullshit fails the temptation and joins in . Now all the bitches were happily chatting and wasting their time which otherwise could have been a good productive day </p>
                <li>No kidding, they actually manage to chat and waste the entire day.Like you would be surprise ,they talk about really silly things and laugh at it.looking at the conversation One can't help but wonder if Corona can inflict brain failure.</li>
                <li> In the midst of all the dry joke, Trumps announces the news of the State Lockdown which invites a Hallelujah from Isolation Lady.But the Hallelujah is short lived. The announcement was another fake news, which btw trumps had always been against(ha!)</li>

                <p>The bitches answers yes or no, but nobody really had an idea</p>
                <li><strong>So the Theatrical PM finally takes the right decision for once and declares complete lockdown for 21 days</strong></li>
        <p>The bitches rejoices and continue to joke and throws in their two cent views about how the government should handle to outbreak. They chat and chat.This unknown energy is beyond comprehension</p>
